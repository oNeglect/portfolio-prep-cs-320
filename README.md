# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By appropriately integrating the tools and tests required to conduct exhaustive and ethical testing during the software development stages, I can guarantee that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. Additionally, I am able to clearly and concisely address the customer requirements, create a strategy to achieve the requirements, and execute the requirements within the program.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How I use the many tools provided inside the client's specifications to interpret user wants and apply them into a software. After further analyzing the criteria, I look into the plethora of approaches to successfully and efficiently incorporate these requirements for a system that is more solid and well-developed. Additionally, I try to comprehend why the requirements are necessary, whether adhering to appropriate security principles, putting integrity measures in place for the system, or generally making the system easier to use, in order to cultivate and combine these user needs as a whole.

# How do I approach designing software?
I use an analytical approach to software design, understanding the nature of the issue at hand and carrying out the design in an ethical and formal way. By so, I mean learning the subtle details of the system, developing connections with the team and the client, and advancing the software, which needs to be meticulously designed. Last but not least, I make sure to plan ahead so that I have enough time to fix any system flaws discovered during the system's development or testing phases.
